**Web Scraper** is a simple web scraper showing how to grab article title and link data from websites. This is best used for websites that contained curated posts or articlees like a news or publication website. In this example, I used The Verge, but is compatible with any website. 

Built with:
```
- Python
- Beautiful Soup
```

To run:
```
- Install Requests and Beautiful Soup for Python 
- Open app.py
- Edit webpage on line 5 to include the website you want to use
- Run (results are printed in log)
```
